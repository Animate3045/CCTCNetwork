ssh user@remote -D 9050 #-D is for dynamic port forwarding.
    must use port 9050, which is the default port for proxychains
    optional -NT - no terminal (can make it cleaner)

proxychains (only tcp traffic - ip a won't work)
actions done from the blue host

ssh user@remote -L 1111:<furtherRemote>:22 #-L is for localhost
    we are telling our local host 1111 to send directly to the far 
    remote port 22 - jack in our example in class. john is our 
    server in this case
