        In line 
            test access point (TAP) - gigamon tap 
                Appliance placed between 2 devices
                best for packet collection, no data loss
                must be placed in-line of network traffic
                not scalable
                will need several installed to capture traffic for other network segements 
            Man-in-the-middle (MitM)
                Attacker can use ARP or some other method/protocol
            - Placed between communicating devices to stop attacks - IPS/Firewall
            - negatively impacts network latency
        Out of band (passive)
            Switched port Analyzer
            - Monitors network segements
            - can detect attacks but not stop
            - Gets copies of network traffic - Intrusion detection system (IDS)
            - no impact to latency

Fingerprinting and host identification
    Fingerprinting
        active OS fingerprinting 
        passive OS fingerprinting
    Open Ports and Protocols
        Windows - 88 (kerberos) 137/138/139 (netBIOS) 445 (SMB)
        Linux - 22 (ssh) 111 (sun rpc)
        Ephemeral Ports 
    Protocol Specific Identifiers
        Http - user agent strings
        SSH - initial connection
        NetBIOS Name Service
    p0f - passive OS fingerprinting
        Looks at variations in initial TTL, fragmentation flag, default IP header packet length, window size, and TCP options
        configuration stored in /etc/p0f/p0f.fp

Perform Network Traffic Baselining
- Snapshot of what the network looks like during a time frame 
- no industry standard
- 7 days to establish the initial snapshot 
- Prerequisitie information
    Objective
    - Determines current state
    - Acertain the current utiliation of network resources
    - Identify normal vs peak network traffic times
    - verify port/protocol usage
        Perform Baselining
            Prep - net diagram, known servers/hosts/devices, known ips/ports/protocols (and forbidden), known traffic flows
            Scope and Objectives - traffic/protocol to capture, which segements, which days, what times
        
        Determine Traffic Flow Through Protocol communication analysis
        Using wireshark - common display filters, protocol hierarchy, coversations, endpoints, I/O graph
