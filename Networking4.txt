RFC 791 - specification for IPv4 header construction
RAW Socket scripts must include the IP header and the next headers
    IPv4 --> TCP etc 

echo "hexencode" | xxd #encode to hex 

xxd -r <DecodeFile> <decodedFile>

in python - 

ip tos 40

TCP header
source port - random high port
destination port match to service
sequence - any
ack - any 

Stream Socket Message Sender
Gorgan Forces have requested you get a message to one of their remote teams that are utilizing the BLUE_DMZ_HOST-1. Utilizing the criteria they provided, generate a stream socket with python3:

Coded information was placed into the video below. Look at the note the woman passes to the man.

https://youtu.be/6WTdTwcmxyo?t=35

    From your INTERNET-HOST to the BLUE_DMZ_HOST-1
    Port number = #Last four digits on the note

    Message = #Name on the note (First letter capitalized)

import socket

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

ipaddr = '172.16.1.15'
port = 5309

# To send a string as a bytes-like object, add the prefix b to the string. \n is used to go to the next line (hit enter)
s.sendto(b'Jenny', (ipaddr,port))

# It is recommended that the buffersize used with recvfrom is a power of 2 and not a very large number of bits
response, conn = s.recvfrom(1024)

# In order to receive a message that is sent as a bytes-like-object you must decode into utf-8 (default)
print(response.decode())
