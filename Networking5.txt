Recon steps
    Network footprinting
        - Collect information relating to target - Network, systems, organization, IP ranges
    Network scanning
        - Port network vulnerability scanning
    Network enumeration
        - resources/shares, users and groups, routing tables, auditing and service settings, machine names, applications and banners, SNMP and DNS, other common services/ports
    Vulnerability Assessment
        - ID Vulnerabilities of the items enumerated
        - Injection, broken auth, sensitive data exposure, XML external entities, broken access controls, security misconfig, Software/components with Known vulns
